# MEMORANDUM: DOM-ASM Single-Pass Architecture Migration

**TO:** Aegis Development Team  
**FROM:** Engineering Architecture Team  
**DATE:** January 2025  
**RE:** HTML/CSS Pipeline Migration to Single-Pass Architecture

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This memorandum outlines the technical implementation roadmap for converting DOM-ASM HTML and CSS components to unified single-pass architecture (`TOKENIZER → PARSER → AST`). The migration implements Ship of Theseus behavioral equivalence principles while achieving measurable performance optimization through state minimization.

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** JavaScript pipeline development remains frozen until HTML and CSS achieve production stability.
